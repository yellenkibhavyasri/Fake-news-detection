 Fake News Detection 
Introduction
Fake news is a growing problem in the digital era, spreading misinformation rapidly across social media and news platforms. This project aims to detect and classify fake news articles using Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

Objective
The goal of this project is to develop an automated fake news detection system that analyzes text content and determines its authenticity using ML models.

üèóHow It Works
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection
The model is trained on a dataset containing real and fake news articles. Common datasets include:

Fake News Dataset (Kaggle)
LIAR Dataset
2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
To improve accuracy, the text data is cleaned and preprocessed:
 Removing punctuation, special characters, and stopwords
 Tokenization and stemming
 Converting text into numerical representation using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer

3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training
Several Machine Learning algorithms are trained and compared, such as:

Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest Classifier
The best-performing model is used for prediction.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Prediction
Users can input a news article, and the trained model will classify it as Real or Fake based on learned patterns.
